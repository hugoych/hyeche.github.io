## About Me

I'm Hugo, a last year PhD Student in Machine Learning at ETH Zürich. I'm supervised by [Prof. Gunnar Rätsch](todo) as part of the [Biomedical Informatics lab (BMI)](todo). My main area of research focus on advancing deep learning methods for event detection in multivariate time series. I work on healthcare application around patient monitoring in the Intensive care unit (ICU).
